# 2IRR10 CBL Autonomous Systems Twinning

This project contains the files for the course 2IRR10 as group: Bombardiro Crocodilo (Group 20). We have chosen the path to use Unity and ROS2 which is easier to implement and harder to code in our opinion comparing to Gazebo. 




## Roadmap

- Create a ROS package for path finding and test it in virtual robot

- Script for making Lidar readings 3D in Unity.
